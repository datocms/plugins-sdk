# DatoCMS Plugin SDK

Monorepo with the TypeScript libraries used to build DatoCMS plugins.

## Building a plugin?

You should not need to install these packages manually. Follow our [Build your first plugin](https://www.datocms.com/docs/plugin-sdk/build-your-first-plugin#set-up-your-project) guide to easily scaffold a plugin with both packages already set up. 

From there, the [Plugin SDK documentation](https://www.datocms.com/docs/plugin-sdk/introduction) and [real-world examples](https://www.datocms.com/docs/plugin-sdk/real-world-examples) cover everything else.

## Packages

- [`datocms-plugin-sdk`](https://github.com/datocms/plugins-sdk/tree/master/packages/sdk)
  - TypeScript SDK to build DatoCMS plugins.
- [`datocms-react-ui`](https://github.com/datocms/plugins-sdk/tree/master/packages/react-ui)
  - React component library to mimic the DatoCMS interface inside plugins.

## Developing

To work on the packages themselves (e.g. to prepare a PR or debug an issue in the framework itself), see the "Developing" section of each package's README: [`datocms-plugin-sdk`](https://github.com/datocms/plugins-sdk/blob/master/packages/sdk/README.md#developing), [`datocms-react-ui`](https://github.com/datocms/plugins-sdk/blob/master/packages/react-ui/README.md#developing). Both are developed in this Lerna monorepo and released in lockstep.

## License

This repository is published under the [MIT](LICENSE.md) license.
